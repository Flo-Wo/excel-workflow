# Workflow for measurement uncertainty (Excel)

This is a program to return the Gaussian notation of values and their uncertainties.

For example, let v be the value and u(v) his uncertainty:

v = 6,1819E-06

u(v) = 1,41224E-08

then the Gaussian notation of this value is 6.182(14)E-6.

With this program you can read values and their uncertainties from an excel worksheet and write the Gaussian notation of them in the same worksheet.
